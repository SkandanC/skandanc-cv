  - title: Researcher
    company: CamachoLab, BYU
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: BYUCL
    location: Utah
    date_start: '2022-03-01'
    date_end: ''
    description: I contribute to the development of open-source Photonic Integrated Circuits simulation packages (called Simphony and SiPANN). I am also a top contributor of gdsfactory, an open-source EDA tool for PICs

  - title: Researcher
    company: Xin Group, Virginia Tech
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: VT
    location: Virginia

    date_end: '2021-12-31'
    description: N2O is a greenhouse gas far more dangerous than CO2 to the ozone layer. I focused ondevloping efficient and cost-effective nanocatalysts to mitigate N2O levels in the atmosphere using DFT and MD computations.

  - title: Researcher
      company: KlinkovaLab, UWaterloo
      company_url: ''
      company_logo: UW
      location: Canada
      date_start: '2019-12-01'
      date_end: '2021-04-30'
      description: Interparticle gap engineering can prove to be a promising platform for designing high g-factor plasmonic nanopolymers. I studied the chiroptical properties of a novel plasmonic polymer through FDTD simulations. I also worked on a project where I studied the structural stability of nanocatalysts using computational methods.
